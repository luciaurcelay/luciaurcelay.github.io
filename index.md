# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, <br/> I'm Lucia Urcelay.

### I'm an AI Scientist with a focus on Computational Biology.

### Currently, I am a Data Science postgraduate intern at Novartis working on scRNAseq Foundational Models.

<br>

I am interested in the following research topics:

- ðŸ”¬ Protein Design. One of my main research interests, focusing on AI for generating novel proteins and exploring their applications in science and medicine.
- ðŸ–Œ Foundations of Generative Models.  Interested in the principles underlying these models and their applications in the omics space. 
- ðŸ§¬ Genomics/Transcriptomics. Interested in computational methods for processing genomics and transcriptomics data.
- ðŸ©» Medical Imaging. Although itâ€™s not a topic Iâ€™m currently researching, this is where I discovered my passion for AI. I am interested in DL models for diagnosis and improving medical decision-making.
