## Machine Learning Scientist working on Protein Design


#### I work in the [AI for Protein Design](https://www.aiproteindesign.com/) research group, led by Noelia Ferruz, at the [Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG)](https://www.crg.eu/). Our research explores the intersection of foundation models and protein design.
