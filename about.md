### What I do now

Currently, I work in the [AI for Protein Design](https://www.aiproteindesign.com/) research group, led by Noelia Ferruz, at the [Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG)](https://www.crg.eu/) (Barcelona). Our research explores the intersection of foundation models and protein design.


### What I used to do

Prior to joining CRG, I was a postgraduate intern in Novartis Institute of Biomedical Research, located in Basel headquarters. My work was focused on scRNAseq foundation models to identify and prioritize novel therapeutic targets in oncology, contributing to drug discovery. I leveraged cancer cell line and patient datasets to perform in silico perturbation of single-cell expression profiles, simulating therapeutic effects. I also fine-tuned and evaluated foundation models to enhance their performance for specific oncology data.

Before joining Novartis, I spent two years working at [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es), Spain's national center of supercomputing. During my time there, I was part of the [High Performance Artificial Intelligence](https://hpai.bsc.es/) group, where I conducted Deep Learning research for medical computer vision projects, specializing in embryology and vascular diseases using CT scans and microscopy imaging. I also contributed to the development and evaluation of medical Large Language Models and ensured the design of trustworthy AI systems by addressing biases, with a focus on healthcare applications.
