### Where I'm from

I was born and raised in the Basque Country, a northern region of Spain known for its amazing food and landscapes.

I studied a bachelor in Biomedical Engineering and then I moved to Barcelona to pursue a masters degree in Artificial Intelligence. As a result, I find myself doing research in the intersection of AI and Biomedical Sciences.

### What I do now

Currently, I am a postgraduate intern in Novartis Institute of Biomedical Research, living in beautiful Basel, Switzerland. My work is focused on scRNAseq Foundation Models to identify and prioritize novel therapeutic
targets in oncology, contributing to drug discovery. I leverage cancer cell line and patient datasets to perform in silico perturbation of single-cell expression profiles, simulating therapeutic effects. I also fine-tune and evaluate Foundation Models to enhance their performance for specific oncology data.


### What I used to do

Before joining Novartis, I spend almost two years working at [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es), the spanish national center of supercomputing. During my time there, I was part of the [High Performance Artificial Intelligence](https://hpai.bsc.es/) group, where I conducted Deep Learning research for medical computer vision projects, specializing in embryology and vascular diseases using CT scans and microscopy imaging. I also contributed to the development and evaluation of medical Large Language Models and ensured the design of trustworthy AI systems by addressing biases, with a focus on healthcare applications.
