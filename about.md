### Where I'm from

ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º I was born and raised in the southeast suburbs of Victoria, Australia â€” a place almost perfecting the ['surbubia as giant nursery'](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html) vision of urban development.

I was raised by a tireless single mother, kept up good grades, and played way too much Call of Duty. I never wanted to program computers, right up until around 23 years old when programming computers became all I wanted to do.
### What I do now

Currently, I help build [**modal.com**](https://modal.com), a serverless cloud platform built for developers and data scientists sick of wrestling Kubernetes.

### Where I'm at now

ðŸ—½ Today, I live in NYC. When I'm not working, you can find me walking a new part of the five boroughs, or stopped in a park to read. There's a lot to love in this vast, grubby city, and I hope to see all of it by foot.

### What I used to do

I spent 3.5 years at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), joining when it had almost 300 engineers and leaving when it had about 1800. I joined as a graduate, hobbling around with a broken leg, and ended up as team lead
of ML Platform. The whole way through I grew under the mentorship of [Greg Roodt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/groodt/).

When not doing Data or ML Platform stuff, I spent quite a bit of time working with the [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build system, and helped maintain the [Python rules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python) for Bazel. It's the future, get on it.

Previous to Canva I worked at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) on their [Answer Bot](https://www.zendesk.com/answer-bot/) machine learning product, and at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) as an application developer intern in their reliability/monitoring team.
